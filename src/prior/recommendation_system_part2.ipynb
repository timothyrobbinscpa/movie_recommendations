    "This cell defines the function `load_data`, which is responsible for loading the movies and ratings data from CSV files, converting timestamps to datetime format, merging the datasets on the movie ID, extracting the release year from movie titles, and one-hot encoding genres. The function also includes error handling to log and raise exceptions if issues occur during data loading."
