    "This cell defines the function `perform_eda`, which performs exploratory data analysis on the merged movies and ratings data. It provides information about the dataset, visualizes the distribution of ratings, the number of ratings per movie and user, genre distribution, and the distribution of movie release years. It also calculates and displays a correlation matrix to understand relationships between different features."
